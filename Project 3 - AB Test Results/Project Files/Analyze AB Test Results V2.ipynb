This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

    "**The p-value is 0.50 is much larger than the results above (nearly 5x).  Again this would confirm that there is no statistical difference in conversions across the old page and the new page, however the rationale for this significant variance seems a bit harder to explain.  I understand broadly that there is a difference due to the one-sided vs two-sided element of the test in that one is either equals or does not and the other (smapling test) was based on being > or not. However I think the variance is also down to overall sample size.  I had previously submitted a version of this file which had an incorrectly calculated p_diffs as I used a short cut and reduced the sample size.  In that instance my p-value from the 'sampling' calculation was closer to 0.50 (similar to that in question m.) Upon correcting this mistake and properly conduction the full 10,000 sample the p-value reduced but remained within the parameters to fail to reject the null hypothesis.  In terms of the z-score its another way to refer to distribution and how far away from the mean a data apoint is.  This would all make sense if there is a p-value of .5 and a z-score of .003 then ultimately the laymens interpretation is that there is no statistical difference between the two pages **"

You can use the __File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)__ menu to save your notebook as an .html file. If you are working locally and get an error about \"No module name\", then open a terminal and try installing the missing module using `pip install <module_name>` (don't include the \"<\" or \">\" or any words following a period in the module name).\n",

If you made reference to other websites, books, and other resources to help you in solving tasks in the project, make sure that you document them. It is recommended that you either add a \"Resources\" section in a Markdown cell at the end of the Notebook report, or you can include a `readme.txt` file documenting your sources.\n",

You can submit your files as a .zip archive or you can link to a GitHub repository containing your project files. If you go with GitHub, note that your submission will be a snapshot of the linked repository at time of submission. It is recommended that you keep each project in a separate repository to avoid any potential confusion: if a reviewer gets multiple folders representing multiple projects, there might be confusion regarding what project is to be evaluated.\n",

If you are having any problems submitting your project or wish to check on the status of your submission, please email us at dataanalyst-project@udacity.com. In the meantime, you should feel free to continue on with your learning journey by beginning the next module in the program."
